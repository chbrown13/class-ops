# Getting Started

To successfully build software, you need a properly configured environment with a variety of tools. Unfortunately, creating consist work enviroments for a development team can be difficult and frustrating, especially in a classroom environment, due to various operating systems, personal configurations, coding editor preferences and setups, etc. Thus, for the majority of workshops for CS 5704 this semester we will be using Docable to create a consistent development environment for everyone to complete activities. Below is a brief tutorial on how to use this interactive tutorial system.
