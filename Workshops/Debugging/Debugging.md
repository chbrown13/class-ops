# Debugging

**Debugging** is the process of finding and removing errors from code. These include _syntax errors_ where a programming language is misused (usually caught by the compiler), _logic errors_ where the code is syntactically correct but there is incorrect output, and _runtime errors_ when the program stops during execution. Research shows debugging is one of the most time-consuming activities for developers and one of the most expensive processes of software engineering.[^1]

Tips for debugging:
- Do not make random or extensive changes to the program! Instead, examine the code to figure out what went wrong.
- Think before you change anything
- Figure out why it went wrong
- Always address the first compiler error listed before addressing the other errors.
- Always recompile after making changes to code because fixing one error will often fix other errors as well.

Many useful tools are available to help software engineers debug their code.
