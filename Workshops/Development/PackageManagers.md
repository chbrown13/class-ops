Package Managers.

**An installation philosophy**
> *Avoid manual installation, automate with package managers!*

When possible, using a package manager can allow you to automate and streamline the installation of tools. Instead of hunting down the right website, finding the right version and dowload link, then clicking through an installation wizard---you let the package manager take care of all those manual steps for you! 

*Tip*: Later on, the ability to automate the installation of software environments becomes important in later stages of software development, such as continuous integration, or deployment.

We will learn how to use package managers to help use manage our system.

*Package managers* are tools for installing libraries and tools, which help manage dependencies and configuration of files and environment variables. 

There are generally two flavors of package managers. 

* *Binary* package managers typically install platform specific dependencies: (`brew`, `choco`, `apt-get`) 
* *Source* package managers typically install libraries you can use in your code: (`npm`, `pip`, `maven`)

## Install a Package Manager on Your System

If you're using Linux, you typically already have a package manager, such as `yum` or `apt-get`. You can skip this section.

#### Installing HomeBrew on Mac OS X

Homebrew is a popular package manager for MacOS. 

Let's check if we have `brew` installed on the system. If not, use the [Homebrew Install Instructions](setup/install-brew.md).
```bash|{type: 'command', platform:'darwin'}
brew --version
```


Here is an example of how to install the utility `wget`.
```bash|{type: 'command', platform:'darwin'}
brew install wget
```

#### Installing Chocolatey on Windows

Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows. Once Chocolatey is installed, you can use it to install other tools on your system using `choco install <package-name>`.

We will check if we have choco installed. If not, use the [Chocolatey Install Instructions](setup/install-choco.md).

```bash|{type: 'command', platform:'win32', failed_when:"!stdout.includes('Chocolatey v')"}
choco --V
```



Important, when running commands that will make changes to your system, you may need to "Run (them) as Administrator". Notice, how when we run this command, `choco` warns us that we are not running inside an elevated shell.

```bash|{type: 'command',platform:'win32', stream: true}
choco install wget -y
```

We can try again, but this time, with a shell that has administrative priliveges:

```bash|{type: 'command', privileged: true, platform:'win32', stream: true}
choco install wget -y
```

Finally, we can remove `wget` using the `remove` parameter.

```bash|{type: 'command', privileged: true, platform:'win32'}
choco uninstall wget -y --remove-dependencies
```

## Practice: Installing useful software

See if you can find the packages for these tools with your package manager and install them (if you do not already have them).

* `wget`, a tool for performing web requests.
* `nc`, a general networking tool (package name might be `netcat`).
* `jq`, a tool for querying and manipulating and JSON files.
* `git`, a tool for man

We'll help you open up the appropriate shell you will need for you system.

Windows (Admin)

```bash|{type: 'command', platform:'win32', privileged: true}
start
```

Mac/Linux:

```bash|{type: 'command', platform:'darwin'}
open -a "Terminal" .
```

After you've installed the appropriate commands, let's check if we have installed these programs on the system...

```bash|{type: 'command'}
git --version
```

```bash|{type: 'command'}
jq --version
```

```bash|{type: 'command'}
wget -V
```
