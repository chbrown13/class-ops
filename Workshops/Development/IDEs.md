Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) enable software engineers to complete various activities related to writing a computer program. IDEs often provide a variety of features to support software development, including syntax highlighting, autocomplete, static analysis tools, debugging functionality, refactoring, multiple language support, integrations with git, code searching, and more...
