# Overview

The development environment workshop provides hands-on experience for students to learn and practice a set of relevant tools and processes used for implementing software in industry. Please read all of the instructions for each notebook carefully for information on how to complete the assignment and details on what to submit. The first two notebooks require working with a partner. You may work with a partner for the final tasks, but work for those activities **should be completed and submitted individually**. This workshop is mostly contained in the markdown files of this directory, and uses an updated version of Docable. All Docable notebook activities will be designated wherever you see the notebook (üìí). For example:
