# Test Plans

A test plan is a detailed document that outlines test cases for a given software system. Test cases are the functionalities and/or features to test in a software system. A good test plan has the following properties:

* Repeatable: able to be replicated by other developers on the team
* Specific: descriptive steps to follow
* Focused: Each test should only analyze one particular function of the system

Black box test plans are documents that use plain language for stakeholders (other developers, independent testers, or even clients) to follow to verify the program. The following activity will allow you to gain practice writing a black box testing plan.

## üìù Activity

For this activity, you must create a black box testing plan with your partner or small group. Your testing plan must contain at least _five_ unique black box testing cases with all of the required test case information (see the [Lecture Slides](https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/145256/files/22374735?module_item_id=1849298)). If your partner is in your project group, write a test plan for how you would evaluate your course project. Otherwise, select one of the examples from the [Project Ideas](https://github.com/CS5704-VT/Course/blob/main/Project/IDEAS.md). Be sure to add what program your testing plan is for and who you worked with to create the document. You should work together to create the test plan, however each person should add the test plan to their Canvas HW5 submission. You may use the template provided in the lecture slides or come up with your own.
